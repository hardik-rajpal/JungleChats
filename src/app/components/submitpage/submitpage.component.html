    <p>This website provides tools to analyze
        ('analyse' if you've been conditioned to hold
        out your pinky while sipping hot water)
        your consumption of the well known video
        hosting platform.</p>
    <p>If you are familiar with Google Takeout,
        proceed to open the page on the right to
        download your latest history from YouTube.
    </p>
    <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1" target="_blank">Open Google Takeout Page</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>If not, follow the simple 2-minute tutorial below.
        <br>
        Note: The program analyzes only your<b> Watch History
        from YouTube.</b> Therefore, it <b>does not require </b>any data
        from the other apps, or even from YouTube.
    </p>

<p>
    On requesting the takeout, you will receive two emails from Google almost immediately
    (unless you've been watching a whole lot of YouTube
    ).
    The second one contains the link to download a zip file containing your data.
    Locate the <b>watch-history.html</b> file and add it
    to the form below. Press Submit and you're good to go!</p>
<form (submit)="submit()">
    <input type="file" #file>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <p #status></p>
